**Socious Impact Job Detector**

Socious Impact Job Detector is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to curate a selection of impact job opportunities. The AI is trained using existing data on impact jobs (about 100,000 impact jobs), searches the web (e.g., Adzuna) to identify impact jobs, aggregates them, and then lists them on the Socious platform.
